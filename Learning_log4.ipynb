    "* Residual Sum of Squares [RSS] is the sum of difference between actual scatter plot points and the y = (mx + c) line, i.e. in other words the distance between the point and the line, when a straight line is drawn from point to linear line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any number of lines with different slope and different y intercept can be drawn for a given scatter plot. To find which one is the correct line we make use of RSS. Minimal the value of RSS better it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One way of pridicting the value is where the point intersects the linear line(y = mx + c)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is not mandatory to have the linear line instead the line can be quadratic or any other higher degree polynomial. As the degree of the line increases the RSS decreases and the higher drgree line passes through all the points of scatter polt.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even if a higher order polynomial is used for drawing the line it is still called linear regression coz the higher order is just considered as a feature.\n",

    "* The method of getting a curve to pass through all the points of the dataset is called overfitting, once the overfitting is achieve we will loose the ability to predict any thing as the model now prepared is for the only given dataset not any other data coming in future.\n",
