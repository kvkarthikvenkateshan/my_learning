    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "Overfitting typically occurs when we try to fit a complex model with an inadequate amount of training data. An overfitted model uses its ability to capture complex patterns by being great at predicting lots and lots of specific data samples or areas of local variation in the training set. But it often misses seeing global patterns in the training set that would help it generalize well on the unseen test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general for a classifier as value of k decreases the risk of overfitting increases, this is because as k decresase say k = 1, now the classifier is affected by noise and outliers and there by decision boundary changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underfitting\n",
    "In case of under fitted model the learned model may not be even able to predict/classify the test vlaues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting and Underfitting for Regression\n",
    "In case of linear regresssion with an underfitted model the RSS (residual sum of saqures) is high and there by the predictions from the model will not be accurate, on the other hand in case of overfitted model that linear regression curve is of higher order with the intension of decresing the RSS but with this approach it tries to cover all the aspects but will not be able to generalize global pattern.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Overfitting and Underfitting for Classification\n",
    "In case of knn classifier with an underfitted model the classification doesn't happen properly coz the model has not considered the majority of the points for classification but, on the other hand in case of overfitted model that knn boundary tries to classify considering all the points , but while doing so it may leave out the obvious global pattern i.e. in order to put a outlier point inside a particular group boundary the model would go on to extend the boundary which leads to undesired results."
